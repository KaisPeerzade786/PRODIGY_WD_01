🚀 First Internship Task – Prodigy InfoTech

This repository contains Task 1 completed as part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

The task focuses on building an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navigation bar is fixed and visible across all pages and dynamically changes its style on scroll and hover to improve user experience and interactivity.

Through this task, I strengthened my understanding of semantic HTML, responsive CSS styling, hover effects, and JavaScript-based DOM manipulation while focusing on clean and user-friendly UI design.

I’m grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for providing this opportunity and a hands-on learning environment that encourages practical skill development.
